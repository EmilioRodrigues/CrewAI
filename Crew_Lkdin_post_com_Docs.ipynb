            "As we enter 2025, my mantra for this year is Raymond Williams' quote:\n",
            "To be truly radical is to make hope possible instead of despair convincing.\n",
            "Certainly we have faced a depressing job market, and ageism persists. But what are the bright spots?\n",
            "With that in mind, I reached out to experts in experienced talent: journalists who cover the issue, academics who study it, heads of organizations that focus on employment, recruiters, policy experts, and more.\n",
            "What they said brought me hope, and also suggested actions we can all take.\n",
            "The Trends\n",
            "1. Demographic trends and workforce longevity will highlight the value of older workers.\n",
            "Experts highlight that people are working longer. That, coupled with a declining birth rate, makes experienced talent a vital part of the talent pool.\n",
            "A trend that will continue. The number of workers over 55 on the job has been inching up for a while now and will continue to. An increasing number of businesses will recognize the need to expand and retain their older worker pool thanks to sheer demographics and will be faced with rejiggering everything from hours to benefits to ¬† keep older workers satisfied. Kerry Hannon , Senior Columnist, Yahoo Finance and author of the upcoming Retirement Bites: A Gen X Guide to Building a Secure Financial Future.\n",
            "Workforce Longevity. Older workers will drive workforce longevity in 2025 as companies tap into their expertise to mentor, stabilize teams, increase employee retention, and fuel innovation. In 2022, the employment rate for individuals aged 55 and older increased to 41.1%. Additionally, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by 2033, 21% of individuals aged 65 and older will participate in the labor force. Experienced professionals aren't just shaping the future of work‚Äîthey're leading it. Emilio Umeoka , Stanford Center on Longevity Ambassador | Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Advocate | Stanford DCI Fellow | Board Member\n",
            "Supply and Demand. Opportunities for 50+ workers will improve in 2025 despite the waning DEI initiatives. The law of supply and demand will be the 50+ worker‚Äôs friend. With the fastest-growing segment of the workforce being the 50+ and declining younger populations, employers seeking skilled and experienced talent will hire and retain more older workers. Karen Brown -- MBA Finance , CEO, iAging\n",
            "Time to Close the Gap. It has been an undeniable truth that our labor economy has consistently produced more jobs than the availability of job seekers. It is also true that older job seekers have consistently underperformed on every major statistical metric in the U.S. workforce. Closing the gap between opportunity and workforce inclusion gives me hope for 2025. Gary A. Officer , Founder & CEO of CWI Labs and CEO, Center for Workforce Inclusion\n",
            "2. Advocacy will continue and grow to combat age discrimination and support age inclusion.\n",
            "There is a strong recognition that we need policies that encourage age inclusion and that we need to strengthen laws against age discrimination. Yes, it's real!\n",
            "Need for age inclusive policies. As the national conversation on workers and the economy continues to dominate headlines, I expect more pundits and decision-makers will recognize both the needs and significant opportunities presented by the growing demographic of older workers. To ensure these workers can thrive in their careers‚Äîand that employers can benefit from their talents‚Äîwe‚Äôll need strong state and federal policies that embed an age-inclusive approach to workforce development and education. Robert Espinoza , CEO, National Skills Coalition\n",
            "Increased advocacy efforts. Nationally, we will see increased advocacy coalition efforts, focused on age-inclusivity and mitigating employment discrimination. More states will be inspired to improve protections from employment discrimination, as we have seen in Colorado. The Job Application Fairness Act prohibits Colorado employers from inquiring about age, date of birth, or educational obtainment dates on an initial job application. Additionally, efforts to mitigate age discrimination will need to broaden advocacy coalition partnerships to address how the use of Artificial Intelligence during hiring processes could intersect with age discrimination. Karen Moldovan , State Director of Advocacy, AARP Colorado\n",
            "Incentivizing employers. Local leaders in 2025 will continue to see the merit in helping to make things easier for older adults who wish to work later in life. Not just by talking but by creating pathways that incentivize employers. Tim Driver , Founder and CEO, Age Friendly Ventures\n",
            "3. The rise of AI is an opportunity for experienced talent.\n",
            "Contrary to stereotypes that some hold, experienced talent may have an advantage as AI use continues to grow, something that I wrote about last year .\n",
            "Experience needed to manage AI. Many business leaders are describing 2025 as the year of AI agents. These are AI tools that can accomplish complex tasks like a human. Managing these tools successfully requires people with years of work experience‚Äîpeople who have the technical skills and judgment to quality-assure the AI agents‚Äô work product. Midcareer and older workers can be well-placed to play this role in 2025 and beyond. Mona Mourshed , Global Founding CEO, Generation You Employed, and author of Age-Proofing AI: Enabling an intergenerational workforce to benefit from AI.\n",
            "Older workers strengths will be of increased value. The rise of AI will amplify the importance of soft skills, where older workers often excel, as experience, empathy, and judgment remain vital for collaboration and innovation. Our research reveals that 70% of strategic meetings do not include anyone over 60‚Äîa missed opportunity to harness the productivity gains of age-diverse perspectives. As AI takes over routine tasks, the social, emotional, and leadership strengths of older workers will only grow in value.

            "Several experts noted that many older workers will pivot to freelance, gig work, and entrepreneurship due to changes in the job market as well as personal preferences:\n",
            "To address a tougher job market and age discrimination by some employers in 2025, I believe older workers will be increasingly turning to freelance, gig, and consulting work. These types of employment will offer them the flexibility to work when and where they prefer. Richard Eisenberg , The View from Unretirement, MarketWatch\n",
            "With so much uncertainty in the economy and job market, it promises to be a good year for older workers who find ways to sell their services to employers as freelancers, consultants, or contractors. \"They may not hire you, but they'll buy from you.\" These client relationships can also lead to employment offers as employers feel more confident about making staffing decisions. Doug Dickson , Co-facilitator, Over-50 Employment Affinity Group of The Encore Network .\n",
            "We will see a lot of older workers take control of their own careers by becoming entrepreneurs or pivoting into new professions. When the dust settles, the data will show that older workers bore the brunt of the layoff boom in corporate; whether by necessity or by choice, there will be lots of new businesses from consulting to products to software led by the over-40 set. Maureen Clough , host of It Gets Late Early .\n",
            "5. Opportunities will be available for the curious, creative and patient.\n",
            "Yes, I know it can feel challenging when you've been job hunting for a while and dealt with being ghosted, but our experts did emphasize the importance of remaining creative, curious and adaptable.\n",
            "New opportunities tailored for older adults. 2025 marks an exciting shift as organizations increasingly recognize and celebrate the incredible value that older adults bring to the workforce through their time, talent, and treasures. It‚Äôs inspiring to see a growing array of unique and rewarding job opportunities tailored for older adults across diverse industries. If you're an older adult seeking a fresh professional adventure, now is the perfect time to embrace curiosity and explore new possibilities. You might discover fulfilling roles you‚Äôve never considered before! Jodi Waterhouse, MHA , Director, Strategic Partnerships & Programs, CU Anschutz Multidisciplinary Center on Aging\n",
            "Shifting skills to growing industries. People who are willing to get creative with their careers can find exciting new opportunities in 2025. This can be the perfect year for older workers to shake things up and change directions. The key is to not just focus on the same profession or industry. Instead, see how the skills you've accumulated across your career can be applied where demand is highest. Those willing to do so will flourish this year. Andrew Seaman , LinkedIn 's editor-at-large for jobs and career development\n",
            "Persistence. I am seeing improvement in the job market and am cautiously optimistic that 2025 will be better than 2024 - I just had a client beat out 1500+ online applicants to land an executive role, so it can be done, but patience and resilience is key. I've been running weekly polls and workers are continuing to look for new work, with¬† 66% of workers ¬†actively looking for new jobs and 20% potentially looking for work, so people are continuing to pivot and shift even in this competitive market.\n",

Happily, older workers who are currently employed will continue to be upbeat and engaged in their work. Two-thirds of those 65 and older say they are highly satisfied with their jobs, compared with 4 in 10 of those 18 to 29 and just under half of those 30 to 49. Kerry Hannon\n",

Regardless of age, people want the opportunity for meaningful employment, fair pay, and workplaces where they feel safe and can thrive. Sheila Callaham , Founder and Executive Director, Age Equity Alliance and Forbes Contributor\n",
            "7. Smart employers will take action to unlock the age advantage.\n",
            "Presently there seems to be some momentum for older workers to be more ‚Äúseen‚Äù, though I am not sure that means they are more ‚Äúheard‚Äù; I believe the linchpin to solidifying a shift to more ‚Äúheard‚Äù in 2025 will be identifying employers who are courageous enough to clearly¬† define and commit ¬† to concrete and measurable steps for implementing ¬†this workforce inclusion imperative. Kim Anderson, NDCCDE, CDR , Founder and CEO of GreySource\n",
            "A personal observation and prediction. Last year, I personally saw a growth in the number and range of employers who engaged me to speak to their teams about the business case for age inclusion and how to make it happen: From a Fortune 50 company to a start-up, from a media company to state agencies and institutions of higher education, and many more. Smart companies are realizing that they need to take concrete actions to rethink their assumptions, reject stereotypes and replace outdated policies with age-inclusive policies that allow their talent of all ages to thrive and flourish.

            "Almost a quarter of Americans ages 50 and older say they plan to make a job switch in 2025, according to AARP‚Äôs survey , released Thursday. That‚Äôs a 10 percent jump in the number of older workers who want a change compared to last year‚Äôs survey.\n",
            "Making a shift seems particularly popular among older Black and Hispanic/Latino workers, with roughly two in five workers from both groups saying they plan to make a job change in 2025.\n",
            "Money is the main motivator for those looking for a job shift. Forty percent of those seeking a change list a higher wage as their main reason for a switch. Ten percent say they want to make a difference or do something meaningful; 9 percent are seeking more retirement savings; another 9 percent want more flexible work arrangements, according to the survey, which polled more than 3,500 people 50 and older.\n",
            "‚ÄúToday, roughly 38 million older adults are working; that‚Äôs more than two and a half times the number of older adults working 40 years ago,‚Äù said Carly Roszkowski, vice president of financial resilience programming at AARP. ‚ÄúWith high prices and inflation continuing to impact everything from housing costs to groceries, it‚Äôs no surprise older adults are looking to increase their income.‚Äù\n",

            "Concerns around age discrimination are valid, according to past AARP research, which consistently shows the impact in the workplace. Almost two-thirds of workers age 50-plus reported seeing or experiencing age discrimination in their work settings, according to AARP‚Äôs 2024 research on work and jobs . Similar rates were found in the 2022 and 2023 data .\n",
            "‚ÄúMany older workers face age discrimination and are often overlooked for jobs they are qualified for, even though they bring expertise, maturity and perspective to the job,‚Äù AARP‚Äôs Roszkowski said. ‚ÄúThis should not be the case.

            "01.19.25\n",
            "It seems like everyone had a ‚Äúpandemic puppy‚Äù or a ‚Äúquarantine kitten,‚Äù right? With stay-at-home orders and the flexibility of remote work, many people took the plunge and added a furry (or scaly or feathery) friend to their household. Fast forward to today, and pet ownership is facing a few more hurdles. From return-to-office mandates to rising costs, pet ownership is barking up a different tree. In fact, pet owners are now 40% less likely to add a new pet to their pack compared to two years ago.\n",
            "Our latest report, Paw Power: Pet Purchasing Trends , digs into what‚Äôs happening in the pet world and how business leaders in the pet industry can keep wagging through these changing times.\n",
            "Is the pet industry growing or shrinking?\n",
            "Spoiler: pretty pawsitive ‚Äì at least at first! Between 2021 and 2024, pet sales have grown each year, with a slight dip expected for 2025. Here‚Äôs the breakdown of sales growth:\n",
            "2021: +12%\n",
            "2022: +11%\n",
            "2023: +10%\n",
            "2024: +8%\n",
            "Compare that to other consumer sectors, which have seen declines and only recently bounced back in 2024.\n",
            "As mentioned, pet owners are more unlikely than ever to add another furry friend to their household pack. The main reasons for keeping the status quo? The price of pet ownership. Three of the top five reasons for being less likely to add another pet center around the cost of pet needs; additionally, spend per unit on pet sector items is up 2.7%. The top reason for holding back on adding another pet in the household is driven by the cost veterinary care and prescriptions (36%). For brands to help alleviate costs, they should look to educate on the benefits of pet insurance in the long-term.\n",
            "What tradeoffs are pet parents making due to higher prices?\n",
            "Many pet owners are turning to private label, seeking out bargains at places like Walmart, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree, where prices are lower (though not cat-astrophically so). Private label share of spend in pet food & treats, for example, grew by 0.5 points, while it dropped in pet supplies by 4.7 points.\n",
            "Interestingly, pet owners are also shifting their shopping habits online and to retailers growing their promotional presence. Amazon and Walmart have been big winners, while traditional pet retailers like Petco and PetSmart have seen declines which have dropped promotional ad blocks by 9% and 35%, respectively. More than three in four shoppers are repeating at Chewy.com, Amazon, and Walmart, while fewer than 3 in 5 shoppers are repeating at Tractor Supply Co., PetSmart, and Petco.\n",
            "How is Amazon differentiating itself from the com-pet-tion ?\n",
            "Consumers are turning to Amazon for not only good pricing but also a level of convenience that brick & mortar retailers can‚Äôt offer‚Äîthe ability to not have to leave the house (or pets).\n",
            "Amazon has grown sales in the dog (+15%), cat (+19%) and reptile (+9%) categories over the past year, and part of this growth comes from Subscribe & Save deliveries. When shoppers set it and forget it, Amazon wins 13% more share of wallet.\n",
            "What is the hot new emerging trend for pet owners?\n",
            "Pets are family, right? And just like us, they need a little TLC for their health and wellness. Pet parents are increasingly growing towards the humanization of pets shown through the pet health category booming. With a 9.2% increase in buy rate, pet wellness is driven by everything from skin care to dental care. Both new and existing pet owners are treating their fur babies to some much-needed pampering.\n",
            "Keeping canine (and feline) chompers healthy was top of mind for pet owners‚Äî1 in 2 shoppers who purchased just one pet health & wellness category purchased a form of pet dental care. Take, for example, brands like HICC Pet and Petlab Co. which have seen significant growth in this space. What makes brands like these interesting is that the products growing in the pet wellness sector center on ideas of digestive health by highlighting terms like probiotics and gut health which further impacts fur and dental health‚Äì a trend reflected in the consumer health sector.\n",
            "However, nearly half (46%) of pet wellness shoppers bought multiple wellness products in the past year showing strong cross-category purchasing once shoppers are in the wellness fold.\n",
            "Who are the pet wellness warriors?\n",
            "Older, high-income couples are leading the charge, with Boomers leading the pack. They care deeply about their pets' health‚Äì 57% say the best nutrition is crucial for their pets, and 43% want them to eat as healthy as they do.\n",
            "Boomers are mostly focused on physical wellness (think dental care, grooming products), while younger generations (Gen Z and Gen X) are into mental health enrichment for their pets.\n",
            "How do brands and retailers capture Gen Z, the next generation of pet owners?\n",
            "Generation Z is taking the pet world by storm‚Äì their pet buy rate grew by 11% vs. YA, compared to just 4% for Boomers+. Gen Z pet owners are 93% more likely to be low-income, 83% more likely to be Hispanic, and 24% more likely to live in urban areas.\n",
            "Because Gen Z are younger, lower income, and living in rentals, they are 27% more likely to have a cat. They also trend toward pet-specific retailers, spending 55% more at Petco and 52% more at PetSmart compared to all pet owners.\n",
            "What Does Gen Z Want for Their Pets?\n",
            "In-store pet-friendly shopping : 30% of Gen Z pet owners say it‚Äôs super important for a retailer to welcome their pets. A trend noticed more broadly in our Numerator Visions 2025 report.\n",
            "Pet pharmacy on-site : They want the convenience of picking up medications for their pets at the store (they are twice as likely to want this compared to other pet shoppers).\n",
            "Cross-species selection : Gen Z wants options for more than just dogs and cats‚Äîthink birds, reptiles, and more!\n",
            "The End of the Leash: Tail-End Insights\n",
            "The pet industry has evolved since the pandemic, but it‚Äôs far from declining in sales. As pet owners continue to embrace e-commerce shopping and invest in their pets‚Äô health and wellness, brands need to stay agile and rethink their retailer partnerships. Traditional pet retailers, especially, will need to rethink their promotional strategies to compete with the likes of Amazon and other retailers that have grown their promotional voice.\n",
            "As for the future? It‚Äôs looking like a tail-wagging success, with Gen Z ready to lead the charge toward even more pet pampering. Whether you‚Äôre in the pet food business, wellness category, or pet accessories, there‚Äôs still plenty of room to grow.\n",

            "Trends For 2025\n",
            "Val Cairney Hi everyone, thanks for joining me on this first episode of 2025, aptly called ‚ÄúTrends for 2025‚Äù.¬†¬† It is hard to believe that another year has gone by. I wanted to look at what we can look forward to for our pets in 2025 and things we may want to put on our list of ‚ÄúThings To Do‚Äù.¬† 2025!¬† Here we come! You likely have noticed some of these trends entering your favourite pet specialty store throughout the last year and even before.¬† But, 2025 is trending for many of these to ramp up and some are new.¬†¬† In no particular order, I‚Äôll start with the increase in pet supplements.¬† Pet Supplements¬† I like this trend as it means that pet parents are embracing the benefit of having their dog on a probiotic or fish oil, vitamins, hip and joint care, and allergy relief that is not a drug.¬† The rise of openness toward seeing the benefits of supplements excites me as I get to have meaningful conversations with pet parents.¬†¬† It is an amazing journey when I drill down with a pet parent to figure out a reason for things such as itching, ear infections or allergies, using principles from the holistic toolbox.¬† Then we can look at things that will help the pet allowing its body to utilize natural ingredients instead of filling them up with drugs and then dealing with the adverse effects from being on drugs.¬†¬†As with all health care, we know there is a time and place when pharmaceuticals are needed, but it is nice to know that there are alternatives, which is an increasing trend.¬†¬†¬† Holistic Pet Health & Wellness On the heel of the increase in natural supplements, there is also an increase in Holistic Pet Health and Wellness.¬† Natural supplements fall into this, but widening the scope here means pet parents are now open to incorporating alternative therapies too.¬†¬† Aromatherapy According to awaysomearticle.com , ‚ÄúIn addition to diet, holistic wellness includes pet supplements, alternative therapies like acupuncture and massage, and stress-reducing techniques such as aromatherapy.‚Äù¬† I‚Äôve noticed quite an increase in U-tube videos on how to massage your dog for example.¬†¬† Aromatherapy is also a great way to deal with stress. However, I suggest consulting a certified aroma therapist to ensure nothing toxic is being used or that the method itself is non-toxic.¬† The article from awaysomearticle.com does mention that CBD products for pets are part of this trend, but I‚Äôll be honest, I have noticed a huge decline in the use and the quest for CBD for pets.¬†¬† CBD Before Covid that‚Äôs all I heard.¬† But, now I actually can‚Äôt remember when I was last asked about CBD.¬† Where I live, pet retailers are not allowed to sell CBD oil for pets, although many do and just risk the consequences.¬† But, as I said, I have found this one to have declined drastically.¬†¬† Technology However, a pet‚Äôs mental health is more at the forefront and is an increasing trend for 2025.¬† For this reason, there is a rise in mental stimulation products meaning that technology is increasing in the pet world.¬† To stimulate our pets and have them feel more relaxed when home alone, more tech products are coming out and gaining popularity.¬† Smart pet cameras, for example, allow the pet to be watched at home. And many of these have 2-way audio, allowing you to hear and talk to your pet. Other devices allow you to do all that while releasing treats on a timer or at your discretion.¬† Apart from tech devices, there are also interactive puzzles that a dog has to solve to get the hidden treats.¬† They have these puzzles for cats too.¬† Even the lick mats and snuffle balls are designed to stimulate a dog or cat and keep them busy.¬† Keeping a pet stimulated through methods, other than a bone, is trending.¬†¬† An increase in tech in the pet world also means an increase in their availability to pet parents.¬† GPS trackers, health apps or devices that monitor a pet‚Äôs activity can detect signs of early illness.¬† Even with cats, the technology has expanded to robotic litters that clean everything out while monitoring how often your cat goes to the litter, letting you know all this via the app.¬† It is quite something! Pet Wellness Pet wellness in general is an increasing trend.¬† Parents are now more concerned about their pet‚Äôs mental health as part of their overall health.¬† The rise of supplements is part of this, but there is more to it such as pets going for massages. Yes, calming, but also for well-being especially for ageing dogs and cats.¬†¬† The dedication I see with pet parents attending to their pet‚Äôs nails monthly is also an indicator. The rise of pet facilities for physiotherapy and hydrotherapy shows how pet wellness is becoming quite a thing.¬† A new facility in a town near me is dedicated specifically to physiotherapy, water therapy, massage, chiropractic, etc. All with exceptionally trained professionals.¬† A facility like this would never have been successful 10 years ago.¬†¬† Oral Care Keeping with this area of trend, also on the rise is the concern and care pet parents are now dedicated to oral care with their pets.¬† At one time, no one in a million years brushed their dog‚Äôs teeth.¬† But, now the understanding of secondary health issues stemming from oral issues.¬† Not to mention the incredibly expensive vet bills when teeth are concerned.¬†¬† Many pet parents are embracing teeth cleaning for their pets using companies like Kissable K9 Care , the first in Ontario to provide the service.¬† Oral care for pets has been trending upward for a while now and is set to increase even more so in 2025.¬† For this reason, I would also caution that although using teeth cleaning services for pets is a major saving and a much easier process for your pet, make sure the service has been around for a while and the technicians are all fully trained.¬†¬† Pet Insurance Expansion With the trend of holistic care for pets on the rise, in 2025 we should see the inclusion of some of these treatments covered by pet insurance.¬† If human insurance can cover dental, massages and chiropractic, it stands that as the humanization of pets increases, pet insurance companies must respond to entice more clients.¬†¬† The other thing as awaysomearticle.com , points out, is that in 2025, ‚ÄúPet insurance providers are becoming more flexible, offering a wider range of plans that cover everything from routine check-ups to major surgeries.¬† There‚Äôs also a growing awareness around pet insurance for preventive care, which can include vaccinations, dental cleanings, and wellness exams.‚Äù¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll likely see further innovations in the pet insurance space with policies that are more affordable, customizable, and accessible to a broader range of pet owners.¬† This will enable more people to protect their pets without the financial stress of unexpected medical bills.‚Äù¬†¬† Natural & Niche Foods Trending annually is the demand for more natural pet foods and niche foods such as freeze-dried and raw.¬† The raw trend has been rising exponentially for years and shows no signs of slowing down in 2025.¬† The rise of Freeze-dried food allows for an alternative diet for pets and convenience for pet parents for travelling and storing.¬† Freeze-dried isn‚Äôt for every pet, but it is on the rise.¬†¬† The data for raw over the next year also shows a significant rise in sales.¬† I have noticed a lot more cat parents have switched their cats to raw.¬† Again, it‚Äôs not for everyone, but there is a significant rise in this area forecasted for 2025.¬† In terms of natural foods, like raw for example, pet parents are also concerned about what is in kibble and treats.¬† I see a lot more pet parents reading labels and asking questions.¬† Thank goodness!¬† Isn‚Äôt that what I always say?¬† Getting in the know takes some time, but the trend is that pet parents are interested and committed to getting in the know.¬† And it is not just the ingredient list pet parents are interested in, they also want to know how the ingredients are sourced and how sustainable the ingredients are.¬†¬† Eco-Conscious Products Pet parents are trending upward to look for more eco-conscious products.¬† Let‚Äôs talk cat litter for a second.¬† Clay cat litter is incredibly destructive to the environment.¬† Access my episode on the scoop on cat litter.¬† It‚Äôs an eye-opener.¬† Pet parents are now thinking about alternative sources of cat litter that are sustainable and biodegradable.¬†¬†Yes, it is usually a bit more expensive but I find it lasts longer and I don‚Äôt have to worry about the dust and the impact on landfill.¬† This eco-consciousness is now fanning out to other products, like food and other products like poop bags and toys that are made from recycled water bottles or bamboo products or coffee wood.¬† Hopefully, 2025 will see a good rise in this trend towards eco-friendly pet products.¬† Friendly Pet Travel This is trending upward as more and more pet parents travel with their pets.¬† This means that airlines, hotels, and Airbnb have to up their game.¬† If you access my episode on Travelling with your pet , you will see that travelling with your pet can have some challenges.¬†¬† Hotels For example, many hotels list themselves as pet-friendly, but when you read the fine print, that means only dogs under 30 pounds.¬† What has that got to do with anything?¬† A 20-pound dog can be just as destructive and ill-mannered as an 80-pound dog.¬† And an 80-pound dog can be just as well-mannered and well-behaved as any 20-pound dog.¬†¬† Airlines To meet this trend, airlines will need to be much more forward-thinking regarding pets coming on board. Awaysomearticle.com states, ‚ÄúExpect to see more companies and services catering to pet-friendly travel, making it easier for people to bring their pets along on their vacations and adventures.¬† For those of us who see our pets as part of the family, this is a long overdue trend.‚Äù¬† I agree! Restaurants This means some restaurants and pubs (the U.K. exempted), will have to get with the programme.¬† My husband and I went overnight to a trendy area 2 hours from us. The hotel where we stayed had pet-friendly rooms that specifically had outside access.¬†¬† We‚Äôve never taken Tundra there. But as we were walking along, one of the restaurants had a sign that said, ‚ÄúPet Friendly‚Äù.¬† We both noticed this immediately, and I said, ‚ÄúHey, if there is a restaurant that we can go to with the dog, maybe next year we will bring him‚Äù.¬†¬† I think as long as it is posted that the pub or restaurant reserves the right to ask an unruly dog to leave, things should go well.¬† Anyway, ask all the pub owners in the U.K. how they do it.¬† It seems not to be a problem.¬† Grief Management¬† This trend is coming to the forefront with the realization that those who have lost a pet are as grief-stricken as those who have lost a human.¬† As discussed in my interview with Erika Sinner , there are now grief counsellors specializing in pet bereavement. Erika has written a book on this subject and works to implement supportive grief policies in businesses.¬† This is a real trend and it is a good one. ¬† Summary¬† These were some of the key pet trends of 2025. While I support all of these developments, I‚Äôm particularly interested in seeing a greater emphasis on holistic pet care. I believe veterinarians should embrace these approaches and integrate them into their practices.¬†¬† My other top priorities for 2025 include: Increased awareness and support for pet bereavement: Recognizing and addressing the emotional impact of pet loss. A surge in eco-conscious pet products: Promoting sustainability and reducing environmental impact. A significant rise in shelter and rescue adoptions: Giving loving homes to animals in need. Increased adoption rates for senior pets, black cats, and overlooked breeds: Challenging common misconceptions and promoting inclusivity. A sharp decline in designer dog breeding and puppy mills: Ending unethical breeding practices. Strong legislation to prohibit puppy mills and backyard breeders: Holding irresponsible breeders accountable. Severe criminal penalties for animal cruelty: Protecting animals from abuse and neglect.‚Äù ¬†I‚Äôm eager for 2025 to be a fantastic year! It has such a resounding quality, promising great things. I sincerely hope all animals awaiting loving homes in shelters and rescues find them. For those who have crossed the Rainbow Bridge, may they be remembered with love and cherished as part of a family. To our furry companions currently enjoying life, I wish them countless cuddles, belly rubs, treats, and playful adventures. I would love to hear from all of you about topics you‚Äôd like to explore on the show. I have some exciting interviews lined up, so stay tuned! Happy New Year to everyone. Remember to continue researching and asking questions, because, as I say, knowing is caring.

Their ascent seems undisturbed by the scandals involving their leaders or links with drug traffickers. \"Don't be ashamed! Abandon your doubts!\" Pastor Renato called out to the thousands of believers assembled before him. In his dark suit and slicked-back hair, the religious leader went into a long sermon on the golden calf. This Sunday, November 26, he was on stage for two hours. With lyricism, humor, hands raised towards heaven or on his knees to pray, the orator stirred the fervor of his flock, many of whom were moved to tears. It was a remarkable spectacle, delivered with the distinct flair that only evangelicals possess. The setting was spectacular. Erected in the heart of S√£o Paulo, the Temple of Solomon purportedly replicates the one in Jerusalem, destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II in the sixth century BC. Today, it is the largest religious edifice in Brazil. It's often touted as \"almost twice the size of the Christ in Rio!\" With its grand scale of 10,000 seats, a length spanning 126 meters and an impressive height reaching 55 meters, it commands a space equivalent to five football fields. At the rear, a \"biblical garden\" offers an immersive experience into the Old Testament, with a replica of Moses' Tabernacle in its \"original dimensions.\" Inaugurated in 2014 by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, the lavish premises ¬† are said to have cost a total of ‚Ç¨210 million.\n",
            "Kitschy and colossal, the complex illustrates the swift rise of evangelicals in Brazil. In the 1970s, the country was still 91% Catholic and 5% Protestant. Five decades later, the ratio is 50% to 31%, or 66 million Protestants, according to the Datafolha Institute. At this rate, the Roman Catholic Church could find itself in the minority as early as 2032: a religious transition of unprecedented speed in a country with a population of 210 million.

            "Dwayne Roberts‚Äîfounder of the Florian√≥polis House of Prayer (FHOP) in southern Brazil‚Äîwas among the leaders who issued a public statement on Bickle a little more than a month ago. The same day, FHOP became the first church to disassociate from Bickle due to what Roberts and FHOP senior pastor Vinicius Sousa called ‚Äúserious allegations of pastoral abuse.‚Äù\n",
            "In the heart of Florian√≥polis Island, in a city of over a half-million people, FHOP functions as a house of prayer, missionary base, and local church. It was established a decade ago by Americans Dwayne and Jennifer Roberts, who were among the first staff members at IHOPKC.\n",

            "FHOP has a significant social media presence: over a quarter-million followers on Facebook and Instagram and nearly 500,000 subscribers on YouTube. Through FHOP Music, the church has gained prominence in the Brazilian gospel scene, with their songs ranked among the genre‚Äôs most played.\n",
            "The impact of FHOP and Mike Bickle himself extends beyond Florian√≥polis and across the charismatic landscape in Brazil, the most evangelical country in South America. Now, a wide swath of leaders has responded with sadness and bewilderment over the recent scandal.\n",
            "‚ÄúThere are eccentric and unreliable charismatic leaders from whom one might expect such things,‚Äù said Marcondes Soares, pastor at Igreja Episcopal Carism√°tica do Brasil in Recife, Pernambuco. ‚ÄúBut Bickle was considered reasonable and highly respected.‚Äù\n",
            "Bickle envisioned a global prayer movement growing out of IHOPKC and had turned particular attention to Brazil in recent years. During a national six-city tour in 2018, he proclaimed that the church in Brazil was on the verge of the most significant revival in its history: ‚ÄúI believe that the hand of God rests uniquely upon the body of Christ in Brazil, preparing it for a global impact.‚Äù\n",
            "Nine of Bickle‚Äôs books have been translated into Portuguese. Growing in Prayer: A Real-Life Guide to Talking with God is one of the most acclaimed titles among Brazilian charismatics.\n",
            "On his two-million subscriber YouTube channel JesusCopy , preacher Douglas Gon√ßalves has conducted multiple interviews with Mike Bickle, as recently as March 2023. Last year, Bickle gave the keynote address at JesusCopy‚Äôs ‚ÄúLead Like Jesus‚Äù youth conference.\n",
            "Israel Subir√°, a composer, preacher, content producer, and son of the preeminent Brazilian pastor Luciano Subir√°, spent a year as a student at IHOPKC. He described this period as when he prayed more intensely than he had in his life : ‚ÄúMost of my time in Kansas was spent in the prayer room. And it was amazing!‚Äù\n",

            "FHOP has brought the movement‚Äôs focus on intensive prayer to Brazil. Arthur Martins, pastor of Igreja Presbiteriana Rep√∫blica in Curitiba, Paran√°, said ‚Äútheir influence is noteworthy,‚Äù with FHOP‚Äôs approach sparking a revival among local churches‚Äô prayer meetings, particularly impacting the younger generation.\n",
            "‚ÄúImmersing yourself in this environment naturally leads you to seek the Lord‚Äôs intentions for the world and the church‚Äôs role in fulfilling his will,‚Äù said Let√≠cia Santos, a full-time missionary at FHOP for four years. She describes the experience as a turning point in her life.\n",
            "But it‚Äôs also drawn some criticism. Ronaldo Crispim, pastor at Igreja Presbiteriana Ber√©ia in Goi√¢nia, Goi√°s, expresses concern about what he perceives as a reductionist view in FHOP‚Äôs worship theology and an exaggerated emphasis on only two elements: prayer and praise. Moreover, he scrutinizes the introspective and vertically oriented spirituality embedded in the notion of a ‚Äúhouse of prayer,‚Äù interpreting it as detached from culture and isolated from daily life.\n",

            "Kate Shellnutt\n",
            "Now, followers and critics alike are grappling with the news of the allegations against Bickle and the continued calls for an independent investigation.\n",
            "‚ÄúIn the ecclesiastical environment of the USA, this is quite common. Every two months, a leader from a megachurch is publicly exposed due to allegations of sexual abuse. Regrettably, this doesn‚Äôt shock me but evokes a sense of sadness,‚Äù said Naam√£ Mendes, pastor at Igreja Presbiteriana Independente in Maring√°, Paran√°, who previously pastored in Miami.\n",
            "By contrast, abuse allegations are rarely disclosed publicly in the Brazilian evangelical context. Typically, these matters are addressed within the ecclesiastical sphere, seldom reaching legal authorities.\n",
            "In Brazil, the silence surrounding sexual abuse is emblematic, as churches often overlook the issues of abuse response and prevention.\n",
            "‚ÄúI am unaware of any collaborative efforts by Brazilian pastors and leaders aimed at preventing sexual abuse within the churches,‚Äù said Z√© Bruno Santos, a member of Igreja Pentecostal Batista El Shadday in Arapiraca, Alagoas.\n",
            "Z√© Bruno, host of the ‚ÄúEntre Amigos‚Äù YouTube livestrea ms, sees an opportunity for Bickle‚Äôs church to model a response for followers around the world. On social media, he said:\n",
            "I have been closely monitoring this case, and I am taken aback by the way the IHOPKC institution, or more precisely, its leaders, have addressed it.\n",
            "This marks a pivotal moment in the charismatic world, not in being for or against Bickle, but in how charismatics will confront cases of abuse and injustice within the faith community.\n",
            "FHOP‚Äôs October 27 statement regarding Bickle emphasized that the church vehemently and unequivocally condemns any form of moral failure in any circumstance and said that the leadership team of FHOP is committed to publicly sharing new information as the facts are clarified.\n",
            "Senior pastor Sousa, though, refrained from commenting further on the matter out of respect for his friends in Kansas, whom he stated are ‚Äúgoing through a tough time.‚Äù\n",
            "Three weeks after the allegations were made public, IHOPKC leaders released an initial report that claimed that the concerns raised surrounding Bickle ‚Äúlacked any semblance of reliability or due process.‚Äù IHOPKC leaders stated that the ‚Äúalleged victims‚Äù they identified were either not credible or had recanted, and therefore it was premature to ‚Äúbring in a third party to investigate.‚Äù\n",
            "The former IHOPKC leaders who brought forward the allegations challenged the response , raising concerns of conflict of interest among the legal counsel, and continued to call for an independent investigation.\n",
            "Last week, the ministry and advocates continues to clash. Ex-staff members protested the ministry‚Äôs 24-7 prayer. Leaders came forward to defend Bickle, and an alleged victim shared her story of sexual abuse in The Roys Report .\n",
            "‚ÄúIn instances like these, social accountability is vital to compel institutions to be transparent and fair in identifying victims and determining the most effective way to assist them,‚Äù said Z√© Bruno. ‚ÄúWhile it may appear righteous for leaders to discourage comments on social media, that is a naive perspective.‚Äù\n",
            "Ziel Machado, pastor at Igreja Metodista Livre in S√£o Paulo, sees several factors contributing to cases of sexual abuse involving religious leaders. ‚ÄúIssues like these are linked to the pride of leaders who choose to work alone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFurthermore, when supervision is present, it often tends to focus on task efficiency, overlooking attention to the pastor‚Äôs true calling.\"\n",
            "Mendes worries about the idolization and shielding of charismatic leaders, which may occur as part of a strategy to protect church growth.\n",
            "‚ÄúThe spiritual and emotional well-being of both the pastor and the congregation often becomes a secondary concern,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwith church members being viewed as mere statistics rather than individuals deserving of compassion and care grounded in the grace and love of God.‚Äù\n",

            "For years, integral mission‚Äîa theological vision that saw evangelism and social justice as inseparable components of Christian life, or as ‚Äútwo wings of an airplane,‚Äù as Ecuadorian theologian Ren√© Padilla once wrote‚Äîhas been a legacy of the Lausanne Movement in Brazil. The concept was developed in the 1970s by members of the Latin American Theological Fellowship and motivated Brazilian evangelicals to fight street violence in Rio, battle alcohol abuse in indigenous reserves, and deliver homeless people from drug addiction , among many other achievements.\n",
            "Recently, however, the legacy of integral mission theology (IMT) has come under scrutiny in Brazil, for generational, demographic, and theological reasons.\n",
            "In June, the Lausanne movement held a conference in S√£o Paulo to present its Great Commission report , an exhaustive survey of trends affecting global missions efforts. Leading up to the event, evangelicals debated on social media whether the event would become a kind of ‚Äú funeral for IMT.‚Äù\n",

            "Most of the speakers were young and had joined the movement only in recent years. And no one mentioned ‚Äúintegral mission‚Äù from the main stage.\n",
            "This reality did not escape the observations of longtime Lausanne leaders, who were focused on the upcoming 50th anniversary of the inaugural conference, which will be held next week in Incheon, South Korea.\n",
            "‚ÄúSome of us are going to Lausanne 4 with this question in mind: what will become of integral mission?‚Äù said Valdir Steuernagel, one of the most prominent Brazilian names in evangelicalism and a senior executive advisor of the Lausanne Movement.\n",
            "Though the controversy over this concept may have reached fever pitch in Brazil, it goes back decades.\n",
            "When integral mission was initially conceived in the 1970s, emerging from the first Lausanne congress in 1974, some evangelicals expressed concern about the implications of a gospel that addressed people‚Äôs material as well as their spiritual needs. Lausanne-friendly evangelicals were often accused of being influenced by Marxist thought or merely adopting a Protestant version of l iberation t heology .\n",
            "These criticisms have persisted over time. In a 2015 video , Reverend Augustus Nicodemus, a former high-ranking leader in the Presbyterian Church of Brazil, described integral mission as ‚Äúa corrupted or, at the very least, incomplete reading of reality.‚Äù Eventually, division over integral mission arose within the national Lausanne network as well.\n",
            "Increasing tribalism within domestic Brazilian politics has intensified the conflicts.\n",
            "In April 2018, pastor Ariovaldo Ramos attended a political rally at which he prayed for Brazil‚Äôs embattled president, Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. Shortly after that, the left-wing leader was sent to jail on corruption charges.\n",
            "That same day, Yago Martins, an influential YouTuber and podcaster in the field of theology,¬† lamented Ramos‚Äôs presence at the event on Facebook, using the situation to criticize integral mission. In his words, it was ‚Äúnothing more than Marxist missiology and theological leftism.‚Äù\n",
            "recommended\n",
            "A Theological Monument to Unity amid Diversity\n",
            "S. Joshua Swamidass\n",
            "Eighteen months later, Lula was freed, and he regained the presidency in the 2022 elections. The impact of Ramos‚Äôs presence at that 2018 event, however, continues to reverberate in the Brazilian church and in the Lausanne Movement.\n",
            "Ramos‚Äîa former president of World Vision in Brazil and founder of the Frente de Evang√©licos pelo Estado de Direito (Evangelical Front for the Rule of Law), which describes itself as a Christian movement promoting social justice and human rights‚Äîhad long been one of the main Brazilian faces of integral mission in Brazil. In the eyes of the opponents of integral mission, Ramos‚Äôs support for Lula was seen as evidence that it was a left-wing political movement, an assertion that Ramos rejects.\n",
            "‚ÄúThe theology of integral mission has no partisan commitment under any circumstances,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen I went to that rally, I did so out of my convictions as a citizen. And when I visited Lula in prison, I did it because I was invited to a pastoral visit. No pastor can deny a visit to someone who is in prison.‚Äù\n",
            "In the following years, political polarization worsened among evangelicals, exacerbated by the contentious 2018 and 2022 presidential elections. Critics on the right observed champions of integral mission conspicuously defending a president (Lula) who had allegedly broken the law. Those on the left asked why evangelicals were supporting a candidate (Jair Bolsonaro , elected in 2018) whom they viewed as making misogynistic and prejudiced remarks.\n",
            "‚ÄúIt has been a very hard season. It has left wounds that are still open,‚Äù said the leader of one Christian social services organization, who asked not to be identified so as not to impede his group‚Äôs ability to collaborate with other ministries. ‚ÄúPeople who are admired and respected, including theologians and missiologists, started avoiding each other and even exchanged insults due to different political views.‚Äù\n",
            "This polarization has had notable consequences.\n",
            "‚ÄúToday, few preachers use the term ‚Äòintegral mission.‚Äô They may even address the topic, but they do not use these words so as not to be canceled, labeled, or excluded,‚Äù said Ramos.\n",
            "Though Lausanne Brazil‚Äôs integral mission task force still exists and the national Lausanne network has not suffered any high-profile resignations, Ziel Machado, who attended Lausanne‚Äôs second global gathering in Manila in 1989 and currently serves as vice-chancellor of the Servo de Cristo Seminary in S√£o Paulo, acknowledges that Brazil‚Äôs divisive political situation has undermined a community once characterized by cooperation and fellowship.\n",
            "‚ÄúThe term ‚Äòintegral mission‚Äô is tarnished and is now part of the conflict,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLausanne teaches us to think about reconciliation. But we can‚Äôt apply this principle if we don‚Äôt address our problems. We need to understand which areas are affected and what reconciliation needs to be made.‚Äù\n",
            "About a year ago, Lausanne‚Äôs Latin America director, Daniel Bianchi, asked whether it was time to retire the phrase. ‚ÄúAt this time it is necessary to recognize that the term ‚Äòintegral mission‚Äô has become a kind of buzzword and has been used for many things to the point of almost losing its meaning,‚Äù wrote Bianchi, from Argentina, who assumed his role with Lausanne in 2017.\n",
            "Fernando Costa, coordinator of the Lausanne Brazil executive committee and executive director of the Centro Evang√©lico de Miss√µes, said that integral mission has weakened after the death of many of its pioneers, such as Padilla and Puerto Rican Orlando Costas. ‚ÄúThis has become something of a dirty word. Anything that is not very healthy for the church is labeled as integral mission,‚Äù said Costa. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unfair to integral mission, but no one will put their face forward to defend it.‚Äù\n",
            "These tensions around the idea of integral mission and within Lausanne have occurred simultaneously with the explosive growth of evangelicals in the country. According to the 1970 census, Brazil had 4.8 million evangelicals, representing 5.2 percent of the population. Today, there are 3.5 million evangelicals just in S√£o Paulo , the country‚Äôs most populous city. Overall, 63 million Brazilians, or 31 percent of the total population, are evangelicals, according to a Datafolha survey.\n",

            "Interview by Geethanjali Tupps\n",
            "Most of these are converts‚Äîonly 7 percent of the evangelicals indicated to Datafolha that they had attended church since birth. In contrast to the evangelicals of the 1970s, these newcomers are joining a movement that enjoys increasing influence in pop culture and politics .\n",
            "Many of these new converts are Pentecostals (in Brazil and Latin America, Pentecostals and independent Christians are counted among evangelicals), who represent about 65 percent of evangelicals in the country. These groups have been underrepresented in the Lausanne Movement, in part because in the past they didn‚Äôt have their own seminaries or colleges, instead relying on less formal frameworks to train their pastors and missionaries or using institutions operated by other groups, such as Baptists, Presbyterians, and Lutherans. This lack of scholars has in turn meant that Pentecostal positions on theology and missiology have been less visible.\n",
            "Indeed, Brazil‚Äôs largest evangelical denomination, the Assemblies of God, was, until a few years ago, averse to theological scholarship and resistant to academic environments. More recently, many Assemblies of God members have sought theological training. ‚ÄúThis has brought them closer to groups like Lausanne,‚Äù said Marcos Amado, who led the Lausanne Movement in Latin America from 2011 to 2016. But it has also created the challenge of integrating a different type of theological tradition into a cooperative environment.\n",
            "Many Pentecostals attended Lausanne‚Äôs June Great Commission event. ‚ÄúWhat I saw was a young crowd very eager to serve Jesus. They have plans. They want to be an influence through social media and spread [the gospel] to as many people as possible,‚Äù said Amado.\n",
            "Costa said that many leaders who are heavily involved in missionary work had limited knowledge of Lausanne‚Äôs history. ‚ÄúWe are working with these individuals who are shaping the Brazilian missionary movement, to bring them closer to the theoretical and theological understanding of mission,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúThey are discovering the identity of Lausanne along the way.‚Äù To do this, they rely on the mentorship of a group of experienced missiologists who have partnered with Lausanne for decades‚Äîolder and more experienced participants like Valdir Steuernagel, who attended Lausanne‚Äôs 1989 global event at Manila.\n",
            "But is there any chance of restoring the image of integral mission, in Lausanne Brazil or elsewhere?\n",
            "‚ÄúThe injury that the theology of integral mission has suffered will be healed only if there is repentance. It may come,‚Äù said Ramos. ‚ÄúI believe in the power of the Holy Spirit to convict people of sin, righteousness, and judgment.‚Äù\n",
            "For Steuernagel, this conflict is part of the Lausanne Movement‚Äôs maturation process: ‚ÄúThere is always tension in these meetings. If you take away the tension, I think you also kill the spirit of Lausanne.‚Äù\n",

            "### 2. Target Audience\n",
